# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements environment-based table separation to allow a single PostgreSQL database to serve both development and production environments with isolated data. The solution will use table prefixes or schemas to separate data between environments while maintaining the same application codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the same PostgreSQL database for both dev and prod environments, so that I can work within the constraints of Render's free tier single database limitation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts in development mode THEN the system SHALL use development-specific tables or schema
2. WHEN the application starts in production mode THEN the system SHALL use production-specific tables or schema
3. WHEN data is written in development mode THEN the system SHALL NOT affect production data
4. WHEN data is written in production mode THEN the system SHALL NOT affect development data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application code to remain environment-agnostic, so that I don't need to maintain separate codebases for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application accesses database entities THEN the system SHALL automatically resolve to the correct environment-specific table
2. WHEN repository methods are called THEN the system SHALL transparently handle environment-specific table routing
3. WHEN JPA queries are executed THEN the system SHALL automatically target the appropriate environment tables
4. IF the environment configuration changes THEN the system SHALL adapt without code modifications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clear separation between development and production data, so that I can ensure data integrity and prevent accidental cross-environment data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing database tables THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between dev and prod tables through naming conventions
2. WHEN performing database operations THEN the system SHALL prevent accidental cross-environment data access
3. WHEN database migrations run THEN the system SHALL apply changes to the correct environment-specific tables
4. IF an environment is misconfigured THEN the system SHALL fail safely without corrupting data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database migrations to work seamlessly across environments, so that schema changes are properly applied to both dev and prod table sets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database migrations execute THEN the system SHALL create or modify tables for the current environment
2. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL ensure proper schema exists for that environment
3. WHEN new tables are added THEN the system SHALL create environment-specific versions automatically
4. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the affected environment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily switch between environments during development, so that I can test against both dev and prod data sets locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment configuration is changed THEN the system SHALL connect to the appropriate table set on restart
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use test-specific tables that don't interfere with dev or prod data
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which environment's data is being accessed
4. IF environment switching occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain data isolation between environments
